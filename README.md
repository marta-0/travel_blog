# Travel Blog

This is my first website project I created while learning HTML/CSS.

## Purpose

The aim of creating this website template was to put some knowledge into practice. I chose 'Travelling' theme to be my 'base' (as it is one of my interests) and created:

* *Home page* displaying images carousel, 'About' paragraph and recent articles,
* *Articles* page showing all added articles divided into 4 categories,
* *Contact* page informing how the author could be contacted,

which allowed to play around CSS styling (including making the website responsive) and to get familiar with the web development in general.

## Further development

If the template were to be used as only 'informative' site, which does not need adding any new articles/subpages, then there would be no need of updating its structure.

If it were to be used as 'blog/journal' site, its way of displaying image links to the articles on the *Articles* tab probably would need to be rebuilt. With more and more articles added, the display may become confusing with too many images showing at once on the site. Furthermore, it could load slower and could become too long to scroll to find an article.

Another improvement that could be implemented here may be a form on the *Contact* tab.
