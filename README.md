# Travel blog

This is my first website project I created while learning HTML/CSS.

# Purpose

The aim of creating this template was to put some knowledge into practice. I chose 'Travelling' as a base theme (as it is one of my interests) and created:

* *Home page* displaying images carousel, 'About' paragraph and recent articles,
* *Articles* page shoiwng all articles divided into four categories,
* *Contact* page informing how the author could be contacted,

which allowed to play around CSS styling (including making the website responsive) and to get familiar with web development in general.

# Further development

If the template was used only as an 'informative' site, with no necessity of adding new articles/subpages, then there would be no need of updating its structure.

However, if it was used as a 'blog/journal' site, then its way of displaying image links to articles on the *Articles* tab probably would need to be rebuilt. Too many images may look confusing at some point after adding more and more articles. Furthermore, the site could load slower and become too long to scroll to find an article. The course of action here could be separating the categories, so that each category would have its own site showing only the articles belonging to it.

Another improvement to implement can be the form on the *Contact* page.
